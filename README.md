Hi! My name is Les Borkowski. 
After 9 years of working within the hospitality industry, I have decided to take on a new path and focus on pursuing a career within software engineering. 
I have been completing various coding courses in my spare time for several years as this is where my passion lies, and I would like to now do this full time. 

So far I completed following courses:</br>

Python2 at CodeAcademy</br>
Responsive Web Design at FreeCodeCamp</br>
JavaScriptAlgorithyms and Data Structures at FreeCodeCamp</br>
Front End Development Libraries at FreeCodeCamp
CS50's Introduction to Computer Science at EDX


Simultaneously I'm working on couple personal projects.</br>
I am interested in Internships or junior roles to start my career.
