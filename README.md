Hi! My name is Les Borkowski. 
After 9 years of working within the hospitality industry, I have decided to take on a new path and focus on pursuing a career within software engineering. 
I have been completing various coding courses in my spare time for several years as this is where my passion lies, and I would like to now do this full time. 

So far I completed following courses:
Python2 at CodeAcademy
Responsive Web Design at FreeCodeCamp
JavaScriptAlgorithyms and Data Structures at FreeCodeCamp

Coures in progress:
Front End Development Libraries at FreeCodeCamp // almost done
CS50's Introduction to Computer Science at EDX // currently at Week7 of 12

Simultaneously I'm working on couple personal projects.
I am interested in Internships or junior roles to start my career.
